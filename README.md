## Unit Test Report (100%)
Our unit test report obtained a 100% success rate as required. Note that only background implementation of the application's logic is tested here; UI elements have been excluded from testing as we have already conducted extensive testing on them via sets of sample inputs and outputs interactively. The overall quality and correctness of the application is still assured.

## Javadoc
Our code has also been well documented with Javadoc. You may find the Javadoc source files in the [`doc` folder](../master/doc), and view the page by opening the [`index.html` file](../master/doc/index.html) inside it with Eclipse.

<br>You may also view the printed version of each page through the linked documents below. However, it should be re-iterated that opening the [`index.html` file](../master/doc/index.html) with Eclipse is preferred to view the Javadoc with appropriate links and formatting/styling.
